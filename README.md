# Point Cloud Super Nova Animation

This webapp animates an explosion of points (a point cloud) centered closed together. three.js with a custom shader is used to create and render approx 2500 points per animation. This project was inspired by the LG television screensaver.    

Built using three.js, TypeScript, WebPack and [CodeMix for Eclipse](https://www.genuitec.com/products/codemix/).
